FROM peoples p
LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.id = a.personId
GROUP BY p.id, p.name;


2.Select all records from Table 1 whose record does not exist in Table 2:

SELECT p.id, p.name
FROM peoples p
LEFT JOIN addresses a ON p.id = a.personId
WHERE a.id IS NULL;


3. Select all duplicate records in Table 2 and show a counter of their iteration in that table:

SELECT a.address, COUNT(*) AS iterationCount
FROM addresses a
GROUP BY a.address
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
